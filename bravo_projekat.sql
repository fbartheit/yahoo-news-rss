Sporting an IP67 rating, the iPhone 7 can survive submersion in water at a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes straight. That\'s all well and good, but it doesn\'t really tell us too much about how the iPhone holds up to water in real world conditions. After all, it\'s not like anyone ever decides to just drop their phone in a meter of water and let it chill there for a half hour. So while we\'ve seen iPhone 7s being put to the test by being dropped in bowls of water, it\'s time to really see what the iPhone 7 is capable of withstanding. In an effort to really put the iPhone 7 to the test, the folks over at SquareTrade Labs came up with an fun little challenge and gave big wave surfer Kai Lenny an iPhone 7 to see how the device stood up to big crashing waves in a salt water environment. DON\'T MISS:  7 ways Apple’s iPhone 7 is much better than any Samsung phone To set the stage, Lenny first affixed an iPhone 6s to the front of his board and hit the ocean waters. Not surprisingly, the device stopped working just 4 minutes in. Apple\'s iPhone 6 Plus model fared a little bit better, albeit just barely, as it managed to survive for nearly six minutes before its audio went out. As for Apple\'s iPhone 7 models? Well, they handled the open waters with relative ease. SquareTrade notes: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: These phones proved they live up to their water resistant claim – with both phones surviving 30 minutes in the salt water with Kai. The iPhone 7 took lead as the winner with only slight audio muffling occurring during the ride. The iPhone 7 Plus still worked after 30 minutes, but the water definitely had an impact on the audio.

Of the two new iPhones, the iPhone 7 Plus is the one that stands out thanks to its dual-lens iSight Duo camera system that packs both a wide-angle and a telephoto lens. Extra RAM, and Apple’s custom image signal processor complete the camera package of the phablet, which might be the first iPhone to offer DSLR-like effects. DON’T MISS: This tool could save you a bunch of money on an iPhone 7 purchase As interesting as the iPhone 7 Plus is, the telephoto lens can currently do only one thing, and that’s offer 2x optical zoom if the conditions are right. Its bokeh blur effect that puts it into DSLR territory is only available to those brave souls who have installed the iOS 10.1 beta 1 , as the feature was not ready in time for the official iOS 10 release. However, there already are plenty of photo samples taken in that new iPhone 7 Plus-only portrait mode that brings over the blur. Well-known Apple enthusiast John Gruber tested the bokeh feature on his iPhone 7 Plus review unit with mixed results. He posted all the unaltered images on Flickr, at this link, including the regular version of the photo, and the one with the depth effect (blur) applied. “Some of them look great, most look pretty good, and at least two of them have serious problems,” he wrote. The samples are work checking out to see how the telephoto lens performs in day-to-day tests, in the hands of a regular smartphone user. Some of them come with explanations that highlight some of the problems of the software in current form. Most of the images are really great, but Gruber points out a few issues with the current beta version of the Portrait mode. He mentions exposure issues, subject edge detection problems as well as problems with blurring patterns. “Look at the doorframe on the right. It\'s blurred, but the bricks right next to it are sharp,” he said about one image. “Patterns like bricks really give the depth effect trouble.” Check out Gruber’s full set of iPhone 7 Plus camera samples at this link , complete with commentary.

(65, 'People are paying 40% more for cable than they were 5 years ago', 'The average price people are paying for cable has skyrocketed by 40% over the last five years, according to a new study from  Leichtman Research. In a survey involving 1,206 adults across the continental U.S., it was found that the average price people are paying for cable these days checks in at $103.10. By way of contrast, the average price consumers paid for cable in 2011 was $73.63. DON\'T MISS:  iPhone 7 review The following chart, via Cordcutting.com ,  illustrates how the monthly cable bill in the United States has been trending upwards for years. In turn, it\'s not surprising that the research also divulges that the percentage of U.S. households that have a monthly cable bill is 82%, down from 87% just five years ago. Funny enough, it appears that The Onion\'s classic story about how U.S. cable companies are just going to arbitrarily charge consumers $100 has essentially become a reality. Offering no justification for the action aside from their own desire to do so, executives from the nation’s leading cable companies announced plans Wednesday to take $100 from every one of their subscribers. Now as to why we\'ve seen a marked increase in cable prices over the years, there are a few theories worth mentioning. One, cable companies have become increasingly adept at luring in subscribers at very alluring prices and then jacking up the subscription costs 18-24 months later. Two, cable subscribers are now willing to pay more for features that were perhaps not deemed to be "necessary" just a few years ago, with DVR subscriptions and HD feeds being two prime examples. Three, as easy as it is to hate on big cable companies, some are offering users a lot more bang for their extra buck with respect to features like On-Demand and mobile viewing options.

Apple\'s iPhone 7 Plus is particularly impressive and capable because it comes equipped with an advanced dual camera system, with one sensor a wide-angle lens and the other a telephoto lens. Admittedly, dual camera systems aren\'t entirely new, but Apple\'s implementation is nonetheless impressive. Aside from being able to take incredible portrait photographs utilizing the bokeh effect, but even regular photos are designed to take advantage of the device\'s dual-camera setup. As referenced in our iPhone 7 review earlier today, the iPhone 7 Plus camera "actually captures two images, one with the 28mm lens and one with the 56mm lens." Following that, Apple\'s software takes data from both images and then fuses them together to create one unified photograph.

Equipped with nothing more than a cheap light ring, a white wall, a chair and some willing test subjects, Rubin shot some nice looking portraits. No hair and makeup, no wardrobe, and only three of the six had ever modeled. The edits are all purposefully minimal — using the beta of Mastin Labs forthcoming Filmborn app for iOS — stopping short of matching levels and white balance precisely across the set (a tweaked preset and curves were applied equally, with slight adjustments to exposure and contrast to help equalize the images). The images were shot using the default camera — which does NOT shoot in RAW. This was intentional, as I like the iPhone’s JPGs 99.9% of the time, and I also like saving space on my phone.

A few weeks ago, a group of hackers allegedly stole an impressively large number of NSA hacking tools and exploits and put them up for sale. Upon close inspection, a number of security experts went on record and confirmed that the leaked exploits were, in fact, from the NSA\'s vast toolkit. When word of the leak broke, some in the intelligence community initially feared that they were facing another Edward Snowden situation. As it turns out, it now appears that the leaked exploits were probably the result of human error. Embarrassingly, an investigation into the matter has revealed that a NSA operative may have inadvertently left the hacking tools in question on a remote computer, effectively leaving it behind as a gift to whomever discovered it.

In the wake of that incident, the NSA opted not to reach out to software and hardware companies with products that were left vulnerable to the now "out in the open" hacking tools. Now as to whether or not the aforementioned operative left the tools behind purposefully or not is a question that investigators are still trying to answer.
